          As a frontend developer, I design and build engaging, responsive web
          applications that blend aesthetics with functionality. I have hands-on
          experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Angular and
          React, enabling me to craft dynamic user experiences and scalable
          solutions. I focus on writing clean, efficient code and staying up to
          date with industry trends to deliver high-quality products.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          In addition to frontend development, I am pursuing a master&apos;s
          degree in Advanced Digital Imaging Techniques (TAID) at the University
          Politehnica of Bucharest, focusing on computer vision and image
          processing. I have a bachelor&apos;s degree in computer science and a
          versatile background spanning frontend, backend, game, and mobile
          development. This diverse experience allows me to adapt to different
          project needs and craft seamless, full-stack solutions.
