          As a full-stack developer, I design and build robust, scalable web
          applications that combine seamless functionality with engaging user
          experiences. I have hands-on experience with frontend technologies
          like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, and React, as well as backend
          development using Java and Spring Boot, enabling me to deliver
          end-to-end solutions. I focus on writing clean, efficient code and
          keeping up with the latest industry trends to build high-quality
          products.
        </p>
        <p className='mt-4'>
          In addition to my professional work, I am pursuing a master&apos;s
          degree in Advanced Digital Imaging Techniques (TAID) at the University
          Politehnica of Bucharest, specializing in computer vision and image
          processing. I hold a bachelor&apos;s degree in computer science and
          have a versatile background spanning frontend, backend, game, and
          mobile development, which allows me to adapt quickly to diverse
          project requirements.
